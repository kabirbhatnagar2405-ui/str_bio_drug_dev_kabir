8. Identify the possible ligand binding sites in the given molecule. Show snapshots depicting
the binding sites and​
List 6 residues from the diametrically opposite ends (along the 3 axes) of any one of the
prominent binding sites.​
Depict them as ball-and-sticks on the protein's cartoon representation (2)
In Discovery Studio
File->open->model.pdb->chemistry->add hydrogens->receptor-ligand interactions->define and
edit binding sites->define sites->from receptor cavities
Different binding sites can be seen by moving the arrows

U can use prankweb to do the same.

9. Using AUTODOCK, find the docking pose of LIGAND1using blind docking method (5).
Report their estimated binding energy and/or predicted IC50 values.(1)

10. Using the binding site from the above, dock the second LIGAND2 using
AUTODOCK-VINA (4)
Grid box generated for the best docking site. Now we will do autodock vina with ligand2

11. Using 2D interaction diagrams, depict the differences in the interactions of the best pose
of these two ligands. (4)
Load model.pdb and then pose1.pdb
